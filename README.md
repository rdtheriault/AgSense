# AgSense

This project was create and developed by my Web Development class for the congressional app challenge. You should be able to run this on any AMP server. As long as the webpage can get to the JSON file it will work. 

Refer to the JSON file in the project to see the correct API for the file. We also included the Raspberry Pi code we used with the GrovePi in order to create the JSON file. You could also probably use the SenseHat. We did need to give Pi control of www in order for this to work.
